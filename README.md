# A social experiment in Story Telling

So what is Rich Content?

Rich content consists of different media formats (sound, video and images) used at the same time and place.

In this project we guide Advocate John. P de Villiers on a self published author's journey.

The goal of the project is a non-typical reader experience with a strong focus on multimedia and integrating 3rd party assets and resources online and augmenting the experience with real world adventures that extend beyond online browsing.

Our project starts life with a clean install of Wordpress and the 2021 Theme.


## Drip Content

To expedite time to market and fast track a drip content strategy, we installed Paid Membership Pro with the Series Add On.

Users will be able to subscribe and read / experience each chapter of the story over time.
